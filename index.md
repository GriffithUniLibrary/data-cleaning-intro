{% include figure.html img="OpenRefine_New_Logo.png" alt="OpenRefine software logo" caption="OpenRefine logo" width="75%" %}

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)  is an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. OpenRefine is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. 

Learn basic data cleaning techniques in this self-paced online workshop such as:

- Exploring tabular data through facets and filters
- Implementing â€˜tidy data' principles
- Cleaning, organising and preparing data for analysis
- Extracting and using a script to automate wrangling on similar data

Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. Give yourself around 2 1/2 hours to complete the workshop.
