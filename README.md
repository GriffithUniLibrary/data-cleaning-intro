# Introduction to Data Cleaning with OpenRefine
A self-paced [online workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/data-cleaning-intro/) developed by staff at [Griffith University Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library).

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) is an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. You can use it to standardise messy or inconsistent data. OpenRefine is particularly powerful when working with large datasets as it can accommodate spreadsheets and files containing millions of rows or lines of text.

Learn basic data cleaning techniques in this self-paced online workshop such as:

- exploring tabular data through facets and filters
- implementing ‘tidy data’ principles
- cleaning, organising and preparing data for analysis
- extracting and using a script to automate wrangling on similar data
    
Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. Give yourself around 2 hours to complete the workshop.
